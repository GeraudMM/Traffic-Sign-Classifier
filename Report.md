### Introduction
In this Project, we will try to sort the German Traffic Signs from [this](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip) database using a Convolutional Neural Network.



### Description

In order to be able to give any image of a traffic sign to our network and hopefully have a good prediction, we will procede this three main parts of the code:

* Load the Data and explore it
* Design and Test a Model Architecture
* Test our Model on New Images

All the code for each step of this algorithm is contained in the `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` Notebook. We'll go through every step one by one.

1. Load the Data and explore it

In this part, we first

3. Test our Model on New Images
